Get product of all other elements

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] --> [120,60,40,30,24]
[3,2,1] --> [2,3,6]

The follow up question is, can you do this without division?
